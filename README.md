Scalon (Scala Object Notation)

This is a lightweight library for parsing and creating JSON documents.
Ultimately, it's a wrapper around other libraries to make the interface
less verbose.

The focus of this library is for the primary interface to revolve around
interacting with Objects and Arrays.
